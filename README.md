# M-Botnet

A small botnet project I have been working on during summer 2018. I am planning to improve it for the sake of learning more about C in Windows and maybe find ways to inject other processes.... TODO!

If you have any cool ideas and want to work on maybe bigger botnet project, contact me :)
